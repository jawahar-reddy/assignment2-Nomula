###### Ladakh is one of my favourite place.

As a travel **enthusiast**, I can say that Ladakh is one of the beautiful place to visit in India.<br> Here we can go on some of the adventurous bike rides in the country.<br> Moreover, Ladakh is famous for **camping** and **trekking**. A lot of tourists from many countries come and visit this place.
